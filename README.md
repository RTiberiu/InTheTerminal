# InTheTerminal - RGU Hackathon 2023

## Description

At the RGU Aberdeen Hackathon in 2023, I took part in a solo 24-hour challenge where I developed a vessel emissions calculator. The application calculates the emissions and route for a map with multiple ports and oil rigs. It also considers adverse weather conditions that could delay the vessel's journey or cause a complete shutdown of a location until the weather improves. The application generates a detailed itinerary of all locations and fuel consumption for the vessel to reach all destinations.

Due to time constraints, I was only able to develop the application in the terminal, without a graphical user interface. With the 2D map and the calculator providing the X and Y route, adding a visual representation would have been straightforward.

Although I would have preferred more time to fully implement the project, I am still proud of the idea and the code's successful execution.

## Running the project

While in the projectâ€™s folder, run in the terminal the command ``node main.js`` to see the path to all the available points. It's important to note that the path generated is fully randomized, meaning that running the command multiple times will result in different outcomes.
